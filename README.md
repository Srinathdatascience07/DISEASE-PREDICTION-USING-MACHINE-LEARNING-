# DISEASE-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-
This project applies machine learning to predict diseases based on medical data. It includes data preprocessing, model training (e.g., SVM , Random Forest), and evaluation. Clone the repo, install dependencies, prepare data, train models, and run predictions. 
# Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Thorough data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling. Â  
Model Development: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks) to build accurate predictive models.
Model Evaluation: Rigorous evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
User Interface: Development of a user-friendly interface (e.g., web application) for symptom input and disease prediction.
